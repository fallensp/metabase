Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `build a dashboard page with nivo library, with different charts and visual and filter . looks impressive,fake data, objective is to illustrate a custom data visualization dashboard` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n   \n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n   \n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n   \n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n   \n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"build a dashboard page with nivo library, with different charts and visual and filter . looks impressive,fake data, objective is to illustrate a custom data visualization dashboard\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"build a dashboard page with nivo library, with different charts and visual and filter . looks impressive,fake data, objective is to illustrate a custom data visualization dashboard\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"build a dashboard page with nivo library, with different charts and visual and filter . looks impressive,fake data, objective is to illustrate a custom data visualization dashboard\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n   \n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3.

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5.

Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

Review Executive Snapshot (Priority: P1)\n+\n+An internal stakeholder opens the dashboard to view an at-a-glance summary of key performance indicators and trending metrics using the preloaded demo dataset.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Demonstrates immediate value by showing the high-level narrative that stakeholders expect from a visualization showcase.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Load the dashboard landing view and confirm that all headline metrics and primary charts render without user interaction.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** the dashboard is accessed for the first time, **When** the default view loads, **Then** the hero metrics, primary charts, and highlight callouts appear within the initial viewport using the demo dataset.\n+2. **Given** the demo dataset contains preconfigured highlights, **When** the user hovers or focuses on chart elements, **Then** contextual tooltips explain the metric and display the data point value.\n+\n+---\n+\n+### User Story 2 - Explore Metrics by Filter (Priority: P2)\n+\n+A marketing manager applies filters (e.g., timeframe, segment, region) to tailor the visuals and compare trends across categories using the demo data.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Enables interactive exploration, which is key to illustrating the dashboard’s flexibility during demonstrations.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Adjust each available filter individually and in combination, verifying charts and KPIs update consistently with visible transition feedback.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** the dashboard is displaying the default data, **When** the user selects a different timeframe, **Then** all charts and KPIs update to reflect the new selection within one second.\n+2. **Given** multiple filter controls are available, **When** the user combines at least two filters, **Then** the visuals and summary metrics refresh to match the combined criteria without visual glitches.\n+\n+---\n+\n+### User Story 3 - Spotlight Key Insights (Priority: P3)\n+\n+A presenter selects predefined insight callouts (e.g., “Top Performing Region”) to quickly narrate standout data points during a live walkthrough.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Supports storytelling—highlighting curated insights increases the dashboard’s perceived polish for demo audiences.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Trigger each insight callout control and confirm the associated visual emphasizes the targeted data point and updates the explanatory text.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** curated insight callouts are available, **When** the user activates a callout, **Then** the highlighted chart element is visually emphasized and the corresponding narrative panel updates with the relevant metric.\n+\n ---\n \n ### Edge Cases\n \n-<!--\n-  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.\n-  Fill them out with the right edge cases.\n--->\n-\n-- What happens when [boundary condition]?\n-- How does system handle [error scenario]?\n+- When a filter combination results in no data rows, the dashboard must show an informative “no data in demo set” message and suggest returning to default selections.\n+- If a user rapidly toggles filters, the dashboard must queue or debounce updates so visuals do not stutter or show inconsistent states.\n+- When the dashboard is loaded on a smaller laptop screen, content must reflow so that all critical KPIs remain visible without horizontal scrolling.\n \n ## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n \n-<!--\n-  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.\n-  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.\n--->\n-\n ### Functional Requirements\n \n-- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., \"allow users to create accounts\"]\n-- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., \"validate email addresses\"]  \n-- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., \"reset their password\"]\n-- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., \"persist user preferences\"]\n-- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., \"log all security events\"]\n-\n-*Example of marking unclear requirements:*\n-\n-- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]\n-- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]\n+- **FR-001**: The dashboard MUST present at least three distinct visualization types (e.g., trend, categorical comparison, proportional breakdown) sourced from the curated demo dataset.\n+- **FR-002**: The dashboard MUST include headline KPI tiles summarizing at least three key metrics aligned with the visual content.\n+- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to adjust demo data via filter controls for timeframe and at least one categorical dimension, with all visuals updating to reflect selections within one second.\n+- **FR-004**: The dashboard MUST provide contextual tooltips and legends so users can interpret chart elements without external documentation.\n+- **FR-005**: The experience MUST include predefined insight callouts or annotations that can be triggered to highlight notable data points or trends.\n \n ### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n \n-- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]\n-- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]\n+- **Demo Metric Dataset**: Fictional aggregated metrics (e.g., revenue, conversions, engagement) structured by timeframe and category to drive charts and KPIs.\n+- **Dashboard Filter State**: User-selected parameters (timeframe, category, region) that determine which subset of the demo dataset feeds each visualization.\n+- **Insight Callout Configuration**: Pre-authored narratives and pointers linked to specific data points or thresholds within the demo dataset.\n+\n+## Assumptions\n+\n+- The dashboard is intended for demonstration purposes only; all data is fictional and does not require backend integration at this stage.\n+- Stakeholders will access the dashboard via modern desktop browsers; mobile optimization is out of scope for this iteration.\n+- Demo audiences expect polished visuals, so animations and transitions are treated as part of the core experience rather than optional enhancements.\n \n ## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n \n-<!--\n-  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.\n-  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.\n--->\n-\n ### Measurable Outcomes\n \n-- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., \"Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes\"]\n-- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., \"System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation\"]\n-- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., \"90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt\"]\n-- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., \"Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%\"]\n+- **SC-001**: 100% of primary dashboard components render with populated demo data within 2 seconds of page load during internal testing.\n+- **SC-002**: Stakeholder reviewers can identify at least three key insights or trends using provided callouts within a 5-minute demo session.\n+- **SC-003**: Applying any single filter updates all visible charts and KPI tiles with consistent data in under 1 second, measured on standard demo hardware.\n+- **SC-004**: At least 90% of demo observers report that the visuals appear polished and presentation-ready in post-demo feedback surveys.\n*** End Patch"}}

Review Executive Snapshot (Priority: P1)\n+\n+An internal stakeholder opens the dashboard to view an at-a-glance summary of key performance indicators and trending metrics using the preloaded demo dataset.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Demonstrates immediate value by showcasing the high-level narrative stakeholders expect from a visualization showcase.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Load the dashboard landing view and confirm that all headline metrics and primary charts render without user interaction.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** the dashboard is accessed for the first time, **When** the default view loads, **Then** the hero metrics, primary charts, and highlight callouts appear within the initial viewport using the demo dataset.\n+2. **Given** the demo dataset contains preconfigured highlights, **When** the user hovers or focuses on chart elements, **Then** contextual tooltips explain the metric and display the data point value.\n+\n+---\n+\n+### User Story 2 - Explore Metrics by Filter (Priority: P2)\n+\n+A marketing manager applies filters (e.g., timeframe, segment, region) to tailor the visuals and compare trends across categories using the demo data.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Enables interactive exploration, which is critical for illustrating the dashboard’s flexibility during demonstrations.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Adjust each available filter individually and in combination, verifying charts and KPIs update consistently with visible transition feedback.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** the dashboard is displaying the default data, **When** the user selects a different timeframe, **Then** all charts and KPIs update to reflect the new selection within one second.\n+2. **Given** multiple filter controls are available, **When** the user combines at least two filters, **Then** the visuals and summary metrics refresh to match the combined criteria without visual glitches.\n+\n+---\n+\n+### User Story 3 - Spotlight Key Insights (Priority: P3)\n+\n+A presenter selects predefined insight callouts (e.g., “Top Performing Region”) to quickly narrate standout data points during a live walkthrough.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Supports storytelling—highlighting curated insights raises the dashboard’s perceived polish for demo audiences.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Trigger each insight callout control and confirm the associated visual emphasizes the targeted data point and updates the explanatory text.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** curated insight callouts are available, **When** the user activates a callout, **Then** the highlighted chart element is visually emphasized and the corresponding narrative panel updates with the relevant metric.\n+\n+---\n+\n+### Edge Cases\n+\n+- When a filter combination yields no data rows, the dashboard must show an informative “no data in demo set” message and suggest returning to default selections.\n+- If a user rapidly toggles filters, the dashboard must queue or debounce updates so visuals do not stutter or show inconsistent states.\n+- When the dashboard is loaded on a smaller laptop screen, content must reflow so that all critical KPIs remain visible without horizontal scrolling.\n+\n+## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n+\n+### Functional Requirements\n+\n+- **FR-001**: The dashboard MUST present at least three distinct visualization types (e.g., trend, categorical comparison, proportional breakdown) sourced from the curated demo dataset.\n+- **FR-002**: The dashboard MUST include headline KPI tiles summarizing at least three key metrics aligned with the visual content.\n+- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to adjust demo data via filter controls for timeframe and at least one categorical dimension, with all visuals updating to reflect selections within one second.\n+- **FR-004**: The dashboard MUST provide contextual tooltips and legends so users can interpret chart elements without external documentation.\n+- **FR-005**: The experience MUST include predefined insight callouts or annotations that can be triggered to highlight notable data points or trends.\n+\n+### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n+\n+- **Demo Metric Dataset**: Fictional aggregated metrics (e.g., revenue, conversions, engagement) structured by timeframe and category to drive charts and KPIs.\n+- **Dashboard Filter State**: User-selected parameters (timeframe, category, region) that determine which subset of the demo dataset feeds each visualization.\n+- **Insight Callout Configuration**: Pre-authored narratives and pointers linked to specific data points or thresholds within the demo dataset.\n+\n+## Assumptions\n+\n+- The dashboard is intended for demonstration purposes only; all data is fictional and does not require backend integration at this stage.\n+- Stakeholders will access the dashboard via modern desktop browsers; mobile optimization is out of scope for this iteration.\n+- Demo audiences expect polished visuals, so animations and transitions are treated as part of the core experience rather than optional enhancements.\n+\n+## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n+\n+### Measurable Outcomes\n+\n+- **SC-001**: 100% of primary dashboard components render with populated demo data within 2 seconds of page load during internal testing.\n+- **SC-002**: Stakeholder reviewers can identify at least three key insights or trends using provided callouts within a 5-minute demo session.\n+- **SC-003**: Applying any single filter updates all visible charts and KPI tiles with consistent data in under 1 second, measured on standard demo hardware.\n+- **SC-004**: At least 90% of demo observers report that the visuals appear polished and presentation-ready in post-demo feedback surveys.\n*** End Patch"}}

Review Executive Snapshot (Priority: P1)\\n\\nAn internal stakeholder opens the dashboard to view an at-a-glance summary of key performance indicators and trending metrics using the preloaded demo dataset.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Demonstrates immediate value by showcasing the high-level narrative stakeholders expect from a visualization showcase.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Load the dashboard landing view and confirm that all headline metrics and primary charts render without user interaction.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the dashboard is accessed for the first time, **When** the default view loads, **Then** the hero metrics, primary charts, and highlight callouts appear within the initial viewport using the demo dataset.\\n2. **Given** the demo dataset contains preconfigured highlights, **When** the user hovers or focuses on chart elements, **Then** contextual tooltips explain the metric and display the data point value.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Explore Metrics by Filter (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA marketing manager applies filters (e.g., timeframe, segment, region) to tailor the visuals and compare trends across categories using the demo data.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Enables interactive exploration, which is critical for illustrating the dashboard’s flexibility during demonstrations.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Adjust each available filter individually and in combination, verifying charts and KPIs update consistently with visible transition feedback.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the dashboard is displaying the default data, **When** the user selects a different timeframe, **Then** all charts and KPIs update to reflect the new selection within one second.\\n2. **Given** multiple filter controls are available, **When** the user combines at least two filters, **Then** the visuals and summary metrics refresh to match the combined criteria without visual glitches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Spotlight Key Insights (Priority: P3)\\n\\nA presenter selects predefined insight callouts (e.g., “Top Performing Region”) to quickly narrate standout data points during a live walkthrough.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Supports storytelling—highlighting curated insights raises the dashboard’s perceived polish for demo audiences.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Trigger each insight callout control and confirm the associated visual emphasizes the targeted data point and updates the explanatory text.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** curated insight callouts are available, **When** the user activates a callout, **Then** the highlighted chart element is visually emphasized and the corresponding narrative panel updates with the relevant metric.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- When a filter combination yields no data rows, the dashboard must show an informative “no data in demo set” message and suggest returning to default selections.\\n- If a user rapidly toggles filters, the dashboard must queue or debounce updates so visuals do not stutter or show inconsistent states.\\n- When the dashboard is loaded on a smaller laptop screen, content must reflow so that all critical KPIs remain visible without horizontal scrolling.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: The dashboard MUST present at least three distinct visualization types (e.g., trend, categorical comparison, proportional breakdown) sourced from the curated demo dataset.\\n- **FR-002**: The dashboard MUST include headline KPI tiles summarizing at least three key metrics aligned with the visual content.\\n- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to adjust demo data via filter controls for timeframe and at least one categorical dimension, with all visuals updating to reflect selections within one second.\\n- **FR-004**: The dashboard MUST provide contextual tooltips and legends so users can interpret chart elements without external documentation.\\n- **FR-005**: The experience MUST include predefined insight callouts or annotations that can be triggered to highlight notable data points or trends.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Demo Metric Dataset**: Fictional aggregated metrics (e.g., revenue, conversions, engagement) structured by timeframe and category to drive charts and KPIs.\\n- **Dashboard Filter State**: User-selected parameters (timeframe, category, region) that determine which subset of the demo dataset feeds each visualization.\\n- **Insight Callout Configuration**: Pre-authored narratives and pointers linked to specific data points or thresholds within the demo dataset.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- The dashboard is intended for demonstration purposes only; all data is fictional and does not require backend integration at this stage.\\n- Stakeholders will access the dashboard via modern desktop browsers; mobile optimization is out of scope for this iteration.\\n- Demo audiences expect polished visuals, so animations and transitions are treated as part of the core experience rather than optional enhancements.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: 100% of primary dashboard components render with populated demo data within 2 seconds of page load during internal testing.\\n- **SC-002**: Stakeholder reviewers can identify at least three key insights or trends using provided callouts within a 5-minute demo session.\\n- **SC-003**: Applying any single filter updates all visible charts and KPI tiles with consistent data in under 1 second, measured on standard demo hardware.\\n- **SC-004**: At least 90% of demo observers report that the visuals appear polished and presentation-ready in post-demo feedback surveys.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.3}}"}}

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     -

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   -

May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\\n\\n### Within Each User Story\\n\\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\\n- Models before services\\n- Services before endpoints\\n- Core implementation before integration\\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\\n\\n### Parallel Opportunities\\n\\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\\n\\n```bash\\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\\nTask: \\\"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\\\"\\n\\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\\nTask: \\\"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\\\"\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Implementation Strategy\\n\\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\\n\\n1.

Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\\n\\n### Parallel Team Strategy\\n\\nWith multiple developers:\\n\\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\\n2. Once Foundational is done:\\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\\n- Commit after each task or logical group\\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.3}}"}}
